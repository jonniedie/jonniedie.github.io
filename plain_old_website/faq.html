            <h4 class="highlight">How much are the fees and how are they collected?</h4>
            <p>
                <span class="highlight">cascaid</span> does not collect any fees itself. There is, however, a flat <span class="highlight">2.9% + $0.30</span> transaction
                fee from Stripe. Payments are set up as a single transaction from the payer to all the end payees (project maintainers)
                at once in order to minimize transaction fees.
            </p>
            <h4 class="highlight">Okay, so what's the catch?</h4>
            <p>
                There isn't one. Much like many of the open source projects <span class="highlight">cascaid</span> was created to support,
                the service lives or dies on donations alone. So I guess that's the catch: <span class="highlight">cascaid</span> might disappear at some point if it can't be
                supported through donations.
            </p>
            <h4 class="highlight">Are recurring donations/subscriptions possible?</h4>
            <p>
                Recurring donations aren't set up yet. This is planned, though.
            </p>
            <h4 class="highlight">Some of my project's dependencies don't have a <span class="highlight">cascaid</span> or Stripe account, can I still add them as a downstream receiver?</h4>
            <p>
                Unfortunately no. The best thing you can do is tell them about <span class="highlight">cascaid</span> and see if they'd be willing to join. But please don't
                spam them about it.
            </p>
            <h4 class="highlight">How can I support <span class="highlight">cascaid</span>?</h4>
            <p>
                The best way to support us is to add the <span  class="highlight">cascaid</span> disbursement node to your payment chain. The second best way is to directly donate to the
                <span class="highlight">cascaid</span> node.
